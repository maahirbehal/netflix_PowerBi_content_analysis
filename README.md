# Netflix Content Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project explores Netflix’s content catalogue using an interactive Power BI dashboard.  
The objective is to translate a public dataset into clear, decision-ready insights around content growth, ratings, genres, and geographic distribution.

The focus is on **business-oriented analysis and stakeholder-style reporting**, rather than static visualisation.

## Business Questions Explored
- How has the number of Movies vs TV Shows changed over time?
- Which content ratings and genres dominate the platform?
- How is Netflix content distributed across countries?
- What insights can be derived at a title level (release year, rating, genres, cast)?

## Dashboard Features
- Trend analysis of Movies and TV Shows over time  
- Content distribution by rating and genre  
- Country-level geographic availability  
- Interactive filters and slicers  
- Title-level drill-down with detailed metadata

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI  
- DAX  
- Data Modelling
